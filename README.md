# Hangouts Plugin for libpurple #

A replacement prpl for Hangouts in Pidgin/libpurple to support the proprietary protocol that Google uses for its Hangouts service.

This plugin is written by [Eion Robb](http://eion.robbmob.com/blog/) and [Mike 'Maiku' Ruprecht](https://bitbucket.org/CMaiku/).
Heavily inspired by the [hangups library](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups) by Tom Dryer (et. al.) using code from [Nakul Gulati](https://hg.pidgin.im/soc/2015/nakulgulati/main/) and protobufs from [Darryl Pogue](http://dpogue.ca/)

## Compiling ##
To compile, just do the standard `make && sudo make install` dance.  You'll need development packages for libpurple, libjson-glib, glib and libprotobuf-c to be able to compile.

## Fedora ##
On Fedora you can use [purple-hangouts](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/xvitaly/purple-hangouts/) COPR repository.

At first time you should add COPR repository and enable it:
```
sudo dnf copr enable xvitaly/purple-hangouts
```
Now you can install packages:
```
sudo dnf install purple-hangouts pidgin-hangouts
```

## Building RPM package for Fedora/openSUSE/CentOS/RHEL ##
```
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,BUILDROOT,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
wget https://bitbucket.org/EionRobb/purple-hangouts/raw/440c6734e1540525b2e25797c3856121e12719ee/purple-hangouts.spec -O ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/purple-hangouts.spec
sudo dnf builddep ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/purple-hangouts.spec
spectool --all --get-files ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/purple-hangouts.spec --directory ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
rpmbuild -ba  ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/purple-hangouts.spec
```
The result can be found in ``~/rpmbuild/RPMS/`uname -m`/`` directory.

## Windows ##
Use the [Windows installer](http://eion.robbmob.com/purple-hangouts.exe) to make life easier, otherwise development builds of Windows dll's live at http://eion.robbmob.com/libhangouts.dll (you'll also need libprotobuf-c-1.dll and libjson-glib-1.0.dll in your Pidgin folder)
