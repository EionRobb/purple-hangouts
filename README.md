# Hangouts Plugin for libpurple #

A replacement prpl for Hangouts in Pidgin/libpurple to support the proprietary protocol that Google uses for its Hangouts service.

This plugin is written by [Eion Robb](http://eion.robbmob.com/blog/) and [Mike 'Maiku' Ruprecht](https://bitbucket.org/CMaiku/).
Heavily inspired by the [hangups library](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups) by Tom Dryer (et. al.) using code from [Nakul Gulati](https://hg.pidgin.im/soc/2015/nakulgulati/main/) and protobufs from [Darryl Pogue](http://dpogue.ca/)
